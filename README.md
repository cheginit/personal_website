# Personal Website

I build the website using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and deploy
it to Github Pages using [ghp-import](https://github.com/c-w/ghp-import).
You can check out the
[workflow](https://github.com/cheginit/personal_website/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml)
file for builiding and deploying steps.
